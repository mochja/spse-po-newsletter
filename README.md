# Newsletter

This project was created from scratch by myself.

Our school needed CMS system for it's newsletter, because an editing bunch of HTML files wasn't easy.

Page style was ported from old [page](http://www.spse-po.sk/newsletter/2009-10/) and just rewritten for newer browsers and fixes some glitches. There was created a redesign for it, but headmaster didn't want to update it anyway, so it's old and not good looking at all. It's ugly in every way.

For articles we are using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.

We also use [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/) for sending emails to our subscribers.

[Capristano](http://capistranorb.com/) is used for one-command server deployment.

The application is written using [Nette](http://nette.org) framework 2.0 and PHP 5.**3** (yeah pretty old, but school don't wanna upgrade it, due to other old parts of the web).

I think this project should be rewritten from scratch. I've successfully graduated from the school and my access to it was removed, so I don't plan to make changes here.
